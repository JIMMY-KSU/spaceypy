Orbital Dynamics and Mission Design 

## Setup

### Python
You just need a valid python 3.5 environment to get rolling. Either install dependencies yourself in existing environment, or use Anaconda. 

Anaconda's Python distribution is recomended for getting started. Easiest way to get started is to install and create a new Python 3.5 environment from the included (not minimal) `py-environment.yml` file. 
http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html

```
$ conda env create -f py-environment.yml
```
Otherwise, if you don't have Anaconda, a working Python 3.5+ environment and a few ancilary modules is all you need.
